    "# Building Models with PyMC and MCMC Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we explored the foundations of Bayesian inference, including Bayes' theorem, conjugate priors, and the mechanics of Bayesian updating for simple models. \n",
    "\n",
    "This session introduces PyMC, a powerful probabilistic programming framework that enables us to build and analyze complex Bayesian models. We'll learn how to specify models using PyMC's intuitive API, understand the theoretical foundations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that make modern Bayesian computation possible, and work through practical examples that demonstrate the complete modeling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build probabilistic models in PyMC**: Understand PyMC's core components including distributions, random variables, and the model context\n",
    "2. **Specify model structure**: Learn how to encode assumptions about data generating processes using priors and likelihoods\n",
    "3. **Understand MCMC fundamentals**: Grasp why we need MCMC, how it works conceptually, and what makes it powerful for Bayesian inference\n",
    "4. **Implement complete Bayesian analyses**: Build, fit, and interpret results from real-world models including linear regression\n",

    "## Building Models in PyMC\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming represents a paradigm shift in how we approach statistical modeling. Instead of deriving update equations or coding samplers by hand, we declare the structure of our model and let the framework handle the computational details. PyMC exemplifies this approach by providing an intuitive interface that closely mirrors mathematical notation while leveraging sophisticated algorithms under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Philosophy of Probabilistic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming fundamentally changes how we think about statistical modeling. Rather than starting with computational constraints and working toward a simplified model, we begin with our actual beliefs about the world and let the appropriate algorithm handle the computational challenges. This approach allows us to build models that truly reflect our understanding of the problem domain, incorporating complex dependencies, hierarchical structures, and realistic uncertainty without being limited by what we can solve analytically or implement by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by specifying what we know:\n",
    "- **Prior knowledge** about parameters before seeing data\n",
    "- **The data generating process** that connects parameters to observations\n",
    "- **The observed data** itself\n",
    "\n",
    "From this specification, a probabilistic programming framework like PyMC automatically constructs the computational graph needed for inference, applies appropriate transformations for constrained parameters, and selects suitable sampling algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyMC's Core Abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC organizes probabilistic models around several key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Model Context**: Every PyMC model exists within a context that tracks relationships between variables. This context manager pattern ensures that all model components are properly registered and connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Variables**: These represent quantities with uncertainty. In Bayesian modeling, parameters are random variables with prior distributions, and data are random variables with likelihood distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distributions**: PyMC provides a comprehensive library of probability distributions. Each distribution can create random variables when used within a model context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deterministic Transformations**: Often we need to transform parameters or compute derived quantities. PyMC tracks these deterministic relationships to maintain the full model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Observed Data**: By marking random variables as observed, we condition the model on actual data, transforming prior distributions into posterior distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore these concepts through hands-on examples."

    "## Model Contexts and Random Variables\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As an analogy, `Model` is a tape machine that records what is being added to the model; it keeps track the random variables (observed or unobserved) and other model components. The model context then computes some simple model properties, builds a **bijection** mapping that transforms between Python dictionaries and numpy/Pytensor ndarrays. \n",

    "## Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how to specify models in PyMC, we need to address a fundamental question: how do we actually fit these models? For all but the simplest cases, the posterior distribution cannot be derived analytically. This is where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods become essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how MCMC works in practice, let's explore the fundamental concepts through concrete examples. We'll start with basic Monte Carlo integration and build up to understanding why sophisticated algorithms like those in PyMC are necessary.\n",

    "### The Challenge of Bayesian Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta|x) = \\frac{P(x|\\theta) P(\\theta)}{P(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator, $P(x) = \\int P(x|\\theta) P(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$, is called the marginal likelihood or evidence. For most models, this integral is intractable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High dimensionality**: With multiple parameters, we need to integrate over many dimensions\n",
    "2. **Complex dependencies**: Parameters often have intricate relationships\n",
    "3. **Non-standard distributions**: The posterior rarely has a recognizable form\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of all Monte Carlo methods is a simple but powerful idea: we can approximate integrals using random samples. Consider estimating the expected value of a function $h(\\theta)$ under a probability distribution $p(\\theta)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[h(\\theta)] = \\int h(\\theta) p(\\theta) d\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can draw samples $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_n$ from $p(\\theta)$, then by the Law of Large Numbers:\n",

    "\n",
    "The key challenge is: **how do we draw samples from a distribution when we only know it up to a normalizing constant?**\n",

    "\n",
    "Random walk samplers face several challenges:\n",
    "- **Inefficient exploration**: Most proposals in high dimensions get rejected\n",
    "- **Slow mixing**: Takes many steps to move between distant regions of high probability  \n",
    "- **Correlation issues**: When parameters are correlated, the sampler zigzags inefficiently through parameter space\n",
    "- **Tuning nightmare**: Step size requires careful manual tuning—too small and you explore slowly, too large and most proposals get rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enter Gradient Information: A Guided Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern algorithms like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and its extension, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), revolutionize MCMC by using **gradient information**—the derivative of the log-posterior with respect to parameters. This is like having a compass that always points toward regions of higher probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of stumbling randomly, NUTS:\n",
    "1. **Follows the gradient contours**: Uses derivatives to understand the \"shape\" of the posterior\n",
    "2. **Makes intelligent proposals**: Proposes distant points along paths of high probability\n",
    "3. **Maintains detailed balance**: Still guarantees correct sampling from the posterior\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference is stark: random walk methods explore blindly through trial and error, accepting or rejecting moves based solely on posterior probability. Gradient-based methods, by contrast, use calculus to determine the direction of steepest ascent in probability, enabling them to make informed, efficient moves toward high-probability regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Advantages of NUTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic tuning**: NUTS adapts its parameters during warmup, eliminating manual tuning headaches\n",
    "2. **Efficient exploration**: Can traverse the entire posterior in a single trajectory rather than thousands of random steps\n",
    "3. **Handles correlations naturally**: Moves along the principal axes of variation, not fighting against correlation structure\n",
    "4. **Scales to high dimensions**: Performance doesn't degrade catastrophically as dimensionality increases\n",
    "5. **Fewer samples needed**: Often 100s of effective samples from NUTS equals 10,000s from random walk methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When NUTS Dominates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-dimensional parameter spaces** (dozens to thousands of parameters)\n",
    "- **Complex posterior geometries** with strong correlations, ridges, or funnel shapes\n",
    "- **Hierarchical models** where parameters at different levels interact\n",
    "- **Any model with continuous parameters** where gradients can be computed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Computational Trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "NUTS requires computing gradients at each step, making individual iterations more expensive than simple random walk methods. However, this cost is overwhelmingly offset by needing far fewer samples for the same effective sample size. It's like paying more for a sports car that gets you there 100x faster than walking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation in PyMC:\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC uses NUTS as the default sampler for continuous variables. When you call `pm.sample()`, PyMC:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatically differentiates** your model to compute gradients (via automatic differentiation)\n",
    "2. **Runs adaptation** to learn the geometry of your posterior (mass matrix and step size)\n",
    "3. **Generates efficient samples** using momentum to explore the posterior\n",
    "4. **Provides diagnostics** to assess convergence and sampling quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of PyMC is that all this sophisticated machinery is hidden behind a simple interface. However, understanding why gradient-based methods are superior helps us appreciate why modern Bayesian computation is so powerful and why NUTS has become the workhorse of practical Bayesian analysis."
